### About me

I'm Monica and I was born in Mexico 41 years ago. I have been married for 18 years with the love of my life. I have been living in San Diego for 4 years. We do not have children but I love dogs, and I have a female shitzu dog (who is the queen of the house) she is with us since she was 3 months old, now she is 9 years old and is blind since she was 6 years old. What I like the most is get together with my family. In Mexican families all is about food and talk.

This dog looks like mine:

### About career

19 years ago I finished my bachelor’s degree on Computer science in Mexico. Then, I worked for almost 15 years in the software industry also in Mexico, Using different kinds of programming languages as:

* RPG III, IV, free format.
* Some Java (Jsp, Beans, Applets, Servlets).
* And including html, css and javascript, but they were the first versions and it wasn’t in a deeply way because I never took classes for   that.
